cooking material for households especially in RURAL INDIA 
1. traditional Chulhas 
2. LPG 
3. Induction 
4. Solar PV 


problem with LPG is the economics of refilling where the cost is 800 - 1100 where the daily income is often less to overcome that ,,, social factor may also come by the way 
for induction the electricity grid at villages are not that matured enough to get that amount power 
for solar it is battery high cost
