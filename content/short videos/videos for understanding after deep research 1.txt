<br> *Visual: Montage of a smoggy skyline, followed by a burning pile of cash.* | **Host:** "Think pollution is just about coughing? Wrong. It’s burning **$95 billion** of India’s economy every single year." 

 |
| **(0:05-0:15)** <br>

<br> *Visual: Text overlay "3% of GDP" pops up. Split screen showing a busy office and an empty chair.* | **Host:** "That is nearly **3% of our entire GDP**. How? Labor productivity drops because people are too sick to work. The IT sector alone loses **$1.3 billion** annually due to pollution-related absenteeism."

<br> *Visual: A deserted outdoor market or cafe with smog filter applied.* | **Host:** "It’s also killing consumer spending. Footfall in shops and restaurants drops by 1.3% when the air turns toxic. That’s a **$22 billion** hit to businesses because people are too scared to step out."

<br> *Visual: Newspaper headline about health costs, graphic of lungs.* | **Host:** "And the healthcare bill? Massive. Premature deaths and illness cost the economy roughly **$45 billion** a year." 

 |
| **(0:35-0:45)** <br>

<br> *Visual: Host speaking directly to camera, serious tone.* | **Host:** "We aren't just losing lives; we are losing our future. Solving this isn't charity; it's the smartest investment India can make. Clean air is good business." |

<br> *Visual: Fast cuts of a Smog Tower, a Cloud Seeding plane, and Anti-Smog Guns.* | **Host:** "Smog towers, artificial rain, and mist guns. Are these real solutions or just **Technological Theater**?" |
| **(0:05-0:15)** <br>

<br> *Visual: The Connaught Place Smog Tower. Text overlay: "₹20 Crore". Map showing a tiny dot.* | **Host:** "First, the **Smog Tower**. It costs over **₹20 crore** to build and ₹10 lakh a month to run. The result? It only cleans air in a **200-meter radius**. To cover Delhi, you’d need **40,000 towers** costing ₹11 lakh crore! Experts call it an 'absolute waste'." 

 |
| **(0:15-0:25)** <br>

<br> *Visual: A plane flying through dry sky. Text overlay: "Failed".* | **Host:** "Next, **Cloud Seeding**. Delhi spent crores planning 'artificial rain'. But guess what? You need clouds to seed! IIT studies proved it's **unviable in winter** because the air is too dry." 

 |
| **(0:25-0:35)** <br>

<br> *Visual: Anti-smog gun spraying water on a truck.* | **Host:** "Then, the **Anti-Smog Gun**. It's basically a glorified sprinkler on a truck. It suppresses dust for a few minutes, but does **nothing** for PM2.5 particles that actually kill you. It’s a band-aid on a bullet wound." |
| **(0:35-0:45)** <br>

<br> *Visual: A field of crops. A bottle of Pusa Decomposer.* | **Host:** "Finally, the **Bio-Decomposer**. It actually works! It turns stubble into manure for just **₹300/acre**. But it failed because it takes 25 days to work, and farmers only have 10 days between harvests. Good science, bad logistics." 

 |
| **(0:45-0:55)** <br>

<br> *Visual: Host shrugs, text overlay: "Fix the Source".* | **Host:** "Stop looking for magic buttons. We need to fix the sources—transport, industry, and biomass burning. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors." |
