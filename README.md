# 🌍 CleanAir Protocol  
**Open Source Air Quality Research & Action Initiative**

---

## 📘 Overview

**CleanAir Protocol** is an open-source initiative dedicated to identifying the root causes of air pollution in India and proposing scalable, sustainable solutions. Our long-term goal is to build a **globally accepted Air Quality Protocol** — a standardized framework (similar to HTTP) for collecting, sharing, and acting on air quality data worldwide.

Air pollution is one of the most urgent public health and environmental challenges of our time. While India bears a significant share of this burden, solutions developed here will help communities everywhere.

## 🎯 Goals

This project aims to:

- 📊 Research and analyze **key air pollution problems** in India
- 💡 Propose **scientific and practical solutions**
- 🌐 Develop an **open Air Quality Protocol** standard
- 🤝 Build a **global and community-driven ecosystem** around air pollution solutions

---

## ❗ Why This Matters

Air pollution has far-reaching consequences:

- Severe health impacts: respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, stroke, reduced life expectancy  
- Economic burden on healthcare systems and productivity  
- Inequitable impact on vulnerable communities  
- Policy implementation gaps that require better data, standards, and action

*This project mobilizes research, data, and community power to drive real change.*

## 🌐 Air Quality Protocol (AQP)

We envision a **globally standardized protocol** for air quality data — open, extensible, and interoperable — enabling:

- Standard formats and terminologies
- API and sensor interoperability
- Real-time analysis and alerts
- Evidence-based policymaking

This protocol is community-designed and open for contributors worldwide.
